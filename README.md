# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose
As the new data analyst at PyBer, I am ask to do an exploratory analysis on some really large CSV files. To Aid this process, we created several types of visualizations to help us make a better report. The report and Visualizations will help our company to improve access to ride sharing service and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. In this challenge we will create a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type
## Results
The data summmary shows that the most rides are done in the urban area, leading to the highest amount of fares and the more drivers needed to cover these rides. The total of rides in rural areas are less than 10% of the rides done in the Urban area. we can conclude that the farther you go from the Urban area, the higher will be the fare per ride, which is normal for the ride sharing market.

The graph helps us vizualise that the urban areas have the most total fares, then comes suburban and last rural. this graph also helps us to determine if there is seasonality in each city type.

## Summary
The Average fare per ride in the Rural areas is more than $10 more expensive than the fare per ride in the urban area, if this is happening due to the demmand being higher than the supply of drivers. I would suggest the CEO to move the amout drivers from the Urban area and give better benefits to attract more drivers to the rural areas. I would also suggest the CEO to collect the data of the distances ran by each driver, Usually rides on Rural Areas are larger than urban areas and this could be an explanation to the fares, collecting this data would help us to undertand better the fare differences. Lastly, I would suggest to engineer a price plan according to distance and demand just like other ride sharing companies do.
